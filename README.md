# UFOs

## Overview
Dana would like to have a more in depth-analysis of UFO sightings, so we would help her to create filtering multiple criteria on the webpage we generated. In this project, we will create the webpage by using JavaScript and HTML that allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. As result, users will be able to search on the webpage by date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
Once the user click on the index.html, the structured webpage will load as Figure 1.

<br> Figure 1: Webpage Layout
<br> The user would see the navigation Bar, Page Header, Article Title, Article Paragraph, Filters for the Table, and Table of Sighting Data. The user could scrolls down to the Filters for the Table and search for the criteria that he/she would like to see. The filters include: date, city, state, country and shape.

<br> For example, the user would like to see the data on 1/5/2010 and NJ state, the user could simply type into these two filters and press enter, then the result will shown as the same in Figure 3.

<br> Figure 3: Result of 1/5/2010 in NJ
<br> Another than pressing enter, the user could also click on the next filter that he/she would like to to see, the result would also load. For example, the user enters 1/5/2010 then click on the blank box under “Enter a State,” all the results of UFO sightings on 1/5/2010 would show. 

## Summary
The drawback of creating this webpage is saving and running the code, because you wouldn’t be able to figure out what went wrong with the code until you load your webpage. JavaScript and HTML must be saved first, so both don’t give the option to run the code line by line. Also, the other drawback of this webpage would be the structure since there are a few empty spaces that could be in use so when the user load the page, all the structure can be in one page. Moreover, the webpage seems to be crowded and not in line for the table and filters. I would suggest additional customization. The webpage now looks crowded with too much wording, it would be great to wether shorten the article or create another page for the users to click on to view the article. Although the page is good enough for beginner to create, it would be great to make the plain page into a better appearance that will interest the users. Moreover, it would be considerable to add images of the shape to the table/result. For example, write the code that have additional pages once the user click on the result to see the image of the shape.
